## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on **fine-tuning open-source language models** such as **LLaMA**, **Mistral**, and others to adapt them for specific tasks and domains. Each fine-tuned model is developed through dedicated experiments contained in various **Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)** within this repository.

Our primary focus is to explore **multiple fine-tuning use cases** and demonstrate how models can be improved for distinct tasks using **`unsloth`** and other modules. Whether you're interested in **text generation, summarization, question answering,** or **domain-specific NLP tasks**, this repository provides modular and scalable examples.

---

## **Architecture and Models**

We will fine-tune the following models:

- **LLaMA**: Meta's LLaMA is a high-performance transformer-based model designed for language tasks. 
- **Mistral**: A cutting-edge open-source model focusing on lightweight and efficient performance.
- **Other Open-Source Models**: Such as Falcon, GPT-NeoX, and Bloom, which will also be explored in relevant use cases.

---

## **Modules Used**

This repository leverages the following core modules:

- **`unsloth`**: A powerful library for model fine-tuning, streamlining hyperparameter management and optimization.
- **Huggingface Transformers**: For pre-trained models and tokenizer utilities.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: Core deep learning frameworks for model training.
- **Datasets Library**: For loading custom datasets and benchmarks.
- **Weights & Biases / MLflow** (optional): For experiment tracking and performance visualization.

## **Use Cases**

We explore several **use cases** for fine-tuning:

1. **Text Generation**: Fine-tune models to generate creative or informative text.
2. **Summarization**: Improve summarization capabilities with custom datasets.
3. **Question Answering (QA)**: Train models on QA benchmarks for better performance.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Adapt models for analyzing text sentiment.
5. **Domain-Specific NLP**: Train models for healthcare, finance, legal, or other industries.

Each notebook in the `notebooks/` folder corresponds to a specific use case, with clear instructions and reproducible steps.
